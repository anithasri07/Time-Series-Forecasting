# Time-Series-Forecasting
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting monthly milk production using classical time series techniques. The data is transformed to achieve stationarity, visualized using rolling statistics and decomposed into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Forecasting is performed using SARIMA and Holt-Winters models.
